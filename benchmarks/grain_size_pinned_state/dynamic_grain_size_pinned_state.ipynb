        "This notebook reports on the test results for test `grain_size_strain_pinned.prm` and allows to compare the test against analytical results. The test models a small volume in simple shear flow with constant strain rate, and a grain size that is not at its equilibrium value. We can compute how much the grain size should change according to the terms given in Eq. 8 of Mulyukova and Bercovici (2018):\n",

The shear heating term $\\Psi$ is $2\\dot\\varepsilon\\tau$, where $\\tau = 2 \\eta \\dot\\varepsilon$, therefore, $\\Psi = 4 \\eta \\dot\\varepsilon ^2$. All other parameters are as given in Mulyukova and Bercovici (2018).\n",

Then, we can compare the ASPECT model results to the analytical prediction, to confirm that we have correctly implemented the equations.\n"
