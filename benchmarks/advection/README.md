Advection Benchmarks
====================

[This folder](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/tree/main/benchmarks/advection)
contains various simple benchmarks to compare different
stabilization schemes (SUPG, entropy viscosity).

Benchmarks:

1. Dropping Box (drop_supg.prm, drop_ev.prm):
   A box falling with a prescribed vertical velocity

2. Rotate Shape (rotate_shape_supg.prm, rotate_shape_ev.prm)
   Various shapes being rotated by 360 degrees by a fixed velocity

See [doc/advection.md](doc/advection.md) for details.
