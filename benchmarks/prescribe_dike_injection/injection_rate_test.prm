# This is a 2D test model to determine if the dike injection functionality is
# working properly. Material is injected throughout the left half of the model
# domain with a rate that corresponds to a velocity divergence of 1e-15 1/s
# and can flow out through the right-side boundary. This corresponds to a 
# linear velocity increase from 0 to 500 m * 1e-15 1/yr = 5e-13 m/s in the
# right half of the domain.
