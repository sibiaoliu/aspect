# Input file for the 2D Rayleigh Taylor benchmark described
# in Rose et al. (2017, 10.1016/j.pepi.2016.11.007).
# The benchmark considers a denser, more viscous layer
# overlying lighter, less viscous mantle. The interface
# between the layers is perturbed, leading to drips along
# the vertical domain boundaries. A free surface allows
# for the development of surface topography.
# Compared to the setup in Kaus et al. (2010), the resolution
# of the layer interface is higher and therefore a timestep
# of 5000 yr is still stable without free surface stabilization,
# while a timestep of 10,000 yr is not.
