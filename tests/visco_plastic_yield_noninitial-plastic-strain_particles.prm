# A test to check whether noninitial plastic strain is correctly tracked
# on particles, which are also used to track plastic and viscous strain.
# The boundary conditions (see tests/visco_plastic_yield_plastic_viscous_strain_weakening.prm)
# produce an incremental strain of 1e-5 per time step and material that is always yielding.
# The initial strain values are as follows - plastic strain: 1e-5, noninitial plastic strain: 0,
# viscous strain: 0. As a result, the viscous strain should always have a value of 0 throughout
# the model run. Respectively, after 3 time steps the plastic and noninitial plastic values
# should be 4e-5 and 3e-5.
