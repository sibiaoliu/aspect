# This model tests the reactive fluid transport material
# 'no reaction' scenario to ensure that there is no reaction
# between the fluid and solid phases. The values of
# porosity (0) and the bound fluid (0.01) are initially
# spatially uniform. The absence of reactions between
# the two phases and near zero velocities (free-slip on
# all sides) produces no change in their values through time.

# As this test is very similar to the reactive_fluid_transport_zero_solubility
# test, we include the latter parameter file and only change relevant parameters.
