# This model generates a representation of a phase diagram for the equilibrium
# wt% water that can be stored in a sediment as shown in Figure 8 of Tian et. al., 2019.
# This model reproduces that phase diagram (very low res by default), with an important
# caveat being that the pressure axis is inverted relative to the ASPECT output.
# A surface pressure of 600 MPa is imposed to reproduce the pressure axis,
# and a lateral temperature gradient is imposed to reproduce the temperature axis.
