####
# This test is based on the Continental Extension Cookbook
# There, the initial temperature is computed through a
# somewhat cumbersome function specified in the input file.
# With the continental geotherm plugin, one only has to
# specify the boundary temperature constraints and layer
# thicknesses of the upper crust, lower crust and mantle
# lithosphere. Other parameters such as layer densities
# are read from other sections in the input file, ensuring
# consistency between the parameters set for the initial
# temperature and those in the material model and compositional
# heating plugins. Significantly, the continental geotherm
# initial temperature plugin enforces that specific names are
# used for crustal and mantle layers, which are specified
# below in the Compositional fields subsection.
