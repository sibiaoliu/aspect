# This is a test for the melting rate functionality,
# in particular the freezing of melt.
# It uses the reactive fluid transport material model composited
# on top of the visco plastic material model.

# The initial porosity has the form of a Gaussian function
# there is a fixed (constant) freezing rate.

# The amplitude of the Gaussian is 0.2, and the melting time
# scale is chosen in such a way that the fraction of melt
# should be cut in half every year (visible in the maximum
# value of the porosity field).

# This is like the rising_melt_blob_freezing test, except
# that it uses the reactive fluid transport material model
# composited with a visco plastic solid material model.
# Outputs of this test and rising_melt_blob freezing should
# be identical except for the the solid viscosity. This is because
# the melt_simple material model uses a simple temperature scaled
# solid viscosity, and the reactive_fluid_transport model used here
# composites with a the visco plastic material model, with a different
# viscosity calculation than the solid in melt_simple.
