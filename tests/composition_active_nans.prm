# When using the 'artificial viscosity' viz postprocessor in parallel,
# we used to put NaNs into the output vector (for ghost and artificial
# cells) that then triggered floating point exceptions. Check that
# this no longer happens. For this, all we need to do is get past the
# first time we create graphical output.
