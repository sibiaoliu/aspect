# This is a very simple test case that checks
# that the implementation of the grain growth
# laws are correct. All parameters, including
# temperature and pressure, are set to constant
# values and no dynamic recrystallization is
# included (the reciprocal required strain is
# set to zero). Material flows in from the left
# and flows out at the right boundary with a constant
# velocity. The grain size
# should then only depend on the x coordinate
# following the relation
#
# d(x) = (d_0 + A * x)^(1/p)
#
# with
# d_0 = 8e-5 m         (initial grain size)
# p   = 10             (grain size exponent)
# A   = 2.0294e-46 1/m
#
# leading to a grain size of d=8.8957E-5 m at the
# right boundary of the model.
