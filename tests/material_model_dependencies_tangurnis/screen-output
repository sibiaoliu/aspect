WARNING: The nonlinear solver in the current timestep failed to converge.
Acting according to the parameter 'Nonlinear solver failure strategy'...
Continuing to the next timestep even though solution is not fully converged.
   Postprocessing:
viscosity depends on
density depends on
compressibility depends on
specific_heat depends on
thermal_conductivity depends on
model is compressible

Termination requested by criterion: end time
