# Test based on the 2D Rayleigh Taylor benchmark described
# in Kaus et al. (2010, 10.1016/j.pepi.2010.04.007).
# The benchmark considers a denser, more viscous layer
# overlying lighter, less viscous mantle. The interface
# between the layers is perturbed, leading to drips along
# the vertical domain boundaries. A free surface allows
# for the development of surface topography.

# The Kaus paper considers a resolution of 50x50 elements.
# We use 64x64 in the benchmark, but reduce it to 8x8 for this test.
