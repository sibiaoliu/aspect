# A test for the grain size material model. The test imposes simple shear
# across a 100 km square domain.
# Over time the model maintains nearly constant temperatures, pressures and
# strain rates.
# The model change in grain size can be compared to the analytical
# equations derived in Mulyukova & Bercovici 2018, which is done
# in a python notebook stored in
# $ASPECT_SOURCE_DIR/benchmarks/grain_size_pinned_state/dynamic_grain_size_pinned_state.ipynb
