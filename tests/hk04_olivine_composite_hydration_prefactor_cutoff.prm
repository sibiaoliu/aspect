# A test case that checks the water fugacity viscous prefactor
# multiplication scheme in combination with the visco plastic material model.
# This test is almost identical to hk04_olivine_composite_hydration_prefactor.prm,
# with the only difference being that the bound_fluid is 0. This test checks that
# the HK04 olivine hydration viscosity prefactor scheme will not divide by 0, but
# will instead use the user input value set using 'Minimum mass fraction bound
# water content for fugacity'. The default value is 6.15e-6 (i.e. 6.15 ppm wt. H2O),
# and so following the same calculation outlined in
# hk04_olivine_composite_hydration_prefactor.prm, where T = 1173 K, P = 1 GPa, and
# edot_ii = 1e-17 1/s, the material model should return 3.1724782150033374e22 Pa s
# for the viscosity.
