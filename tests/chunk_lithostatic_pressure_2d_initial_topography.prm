# In this variation on chunk_lithostatic_pressure_2d.prm
# we test whether the point_is_in_domain function
# handles the initial topography correctly. We therefore
# add an initial topography and pick a representative point
# for the initial lithostatic pressure that lies above
# the unperturbed surface but below the surface plus
# initial topography.
