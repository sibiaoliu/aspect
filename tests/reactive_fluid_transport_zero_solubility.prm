# reaction scenario, where all of the bound fluid in a solid
# with zero solubility should go into the free fluid phase
# (tracked by porosity field). The model begins with no free fluid
# (zero porosity) and 1% bound fluid (0.01). For a fluid reaction
# time scale of 1e3 years and a time step size of 10e3 years,
# the reaction should be complete at the end of the first time step
# giving a porosity of 0.01 and a bound fluid value of 0.
