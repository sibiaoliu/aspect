# A test based on the SolKz benchmark that performs a cellwise
# average using harmonic averaging from particle properties to
# compositional fields that are flagged as 'particle' advected fields.

# Note that since the test performs harmonic averaging, the density
# values being averaged all have to be positive, which required a
# modification of the original density from the benchmark. Therefore,
# the error in pressure is large (since the pressure no longer
# corresponds to the analytical solution).
