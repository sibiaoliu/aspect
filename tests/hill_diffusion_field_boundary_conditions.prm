# This setup tests the compositional field boundary conditions
# along a deforming boundary. To determine whether a part of the
# boundary experiences in- or outflow, the mesh velocity is
# subtracted from the material velocity. In this test, the
# prescribed material velocity is zero, and only the erosion
# or deposition (decrease or increase in height) by the diffusion
# applied to the surface topography determines whether boundary
# conditions should be applied (inflow/deposition),
# or not (outflow/erosion).
