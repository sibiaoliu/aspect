# This test checks whether the viscoelastic bending beam benchmark
# runs successfully. In particular, this benchmark is a good test to
# ensure that a model with compositional fields that affect material
# properties works. This test is identical to the test
# tests/viscoelastic_bending_beam.prm, except that the GMG Stokes solver
# and material averaging (required for GMG) is used here. Significantly,
# the use of material averaging will produce deviations between the
# results of the two tests, as the calculated and stresses are
# influenced by averaging across the material interfaces.
