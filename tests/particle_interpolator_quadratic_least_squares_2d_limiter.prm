# A test based on the 2d version of the SolKz benchmark that (1) tests to
# ensure that the particle methodology when used with the Quadratic Least
# Squares Particle Interpolation algorithm correctly computes the particle
# version of the Solkz benchmark and (2) tests that the Quadratic Least
# Squares limiter is properly limiting, without disproportionately
# affecting the accuracy of the interpolation algorithm.
