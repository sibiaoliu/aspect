An error occurred in file <initial_conditions.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    advection_field_has_been_found[advection_field] == true
Additional information: 
    The field composition 1 (function) is marked as advected by particles,
    but no particle property exists that is mapped to this field. Make
    sure that the particle property exists and is mapped to the correct
    field in the parameter file.
