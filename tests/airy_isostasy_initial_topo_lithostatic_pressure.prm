# We setup three columns, of which the middle column has a higher density
# and viscosity. By choosing a free surface in combination with a
# prescribed lithostatic pressure,
# we see the middle column sink until isostasy is reached (if end time is increased)
# Compared to airy_isostasy.prm, we start off with a nonzero initial topography.
# This test in particular tests the point_is_in_domain function of the geometry
# model. It should take into account the initial topography and find that the
# Representative point lies within the domain. At x = 0.2, the initial topography
# is namely 0.02948.
