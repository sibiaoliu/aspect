# A test case for shear heating. The viscosity is constant and a
# constant shear strain rate is applied by prescribing the velocities
# at the upper and lower boundaries of the box domain; the sides are
# periodic. This yields a constant strain rate [[0,1/2],[1/2,0]]
# with norm |dot eps|=1/sqrt(2), so that together with the viscosity
# of 1, the shear heating 2 * eta * pow(|dot eps|,2) = 1.
# We then limit the stress that is being used in the shear heating
# computation to 0.5 Pa (half of the stress in the model), so the
# resulting shear heating is 0.5 W/kg.
