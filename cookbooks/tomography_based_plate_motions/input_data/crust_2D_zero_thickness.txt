# 2D version of the crustal structure dataset with zero thickness.
# The values are set to a negative depth to make sure that no point falls
# below this depth, and because the adiabatic boundary initial temperature,
# which is required for the equilibrium grain size material model, does not
# work with a depth of zero.
# Only next line is parsed in format: [nx] [ny] [nz] because of keyword "POINTS:"
