    "#### subsection Geometry model\n",
    "    \n",
    "ASPECT has many built in geometry models such as “box” and “shell” and \"chunk\". \n",
    "\n",
    "A box is a rectangle in 2-D and a cuboid in 3-D.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your .prm file, \n",
    "* X extent is width\n",
    "* Y extent is depth\n",
    "\n",
    "Units of length is meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### subsection Initial temperature model\n",
    "ASPECT has built in initial condition models to specify the temperature initial conditions and framework for users to implement custom initial condition models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function lets us specify the initial temperature as a mathematical formula, with user defined constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here, a sinusoidal perturbation of a linear temperature profile is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### subsection Boundary temperature model\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary temperature of your box can be specified using Top, Bottom, Left, and Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperatures are in K.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### subsection Model settings\n",
    "Each geometry model has a set of “boundary indicators” that identifies each boundary in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2D box model, the boundary identification is Left or 0, Right or 1, Bottom or 2, Top or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here:\n",
    "* The temperature on the bottom and top boundaries is fixed.\n",
    "* All four sides of the box have only a tangential component to the velocity (zero normal component).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set adiabatic, shear, or radiogenic heating in this subsection as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### subsection Material model\n",
    "ASPECT provides various built in material models and a framework for users to implement custom material models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here, the built in simple material model is used:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\rho( T) = \\rho_0 ( 1 - \\beta ( T - T_{ref})\n",
    "  \\eta(T) = \\eta_0\\epsilon^{\\eta_T \\Delta T/T_{ref}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta_0$ is set by the VISCOSITY parameter, $\\rho_0$ is the default value $3300kg/m^3$, and \n",
    "$\\eta_T = 1$ (viscosity does not depend on the composition).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other parameters which control reference density, temperature dependence of\n",
    "viscosity, etc. These have default values shown in Section 4.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### subsection Mesh refinement\n",
    "Initial global refinement specifies the \"grid spacing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here: \n",
    "* Initial global refinement was set to 4 corresponding to a 16x16 grid. Setting refinement to 3 corresponds to an 8x8 grid; Setting refinement to 16 correspond to a 32x32 grid.  \n",
    "* Adaptive mesh refinement is turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### subsection Postprocess\n",
    "This section of the parameter file specifies how to analyze the data that has been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here:\n",
    "* Post processors include velocity, temperature, heat flux statistics, and visualization.\n",
    "* Graphical output is generated every 0.01 years (simulation time!)\n",
