# This cookbook simulates a kinematically-driven 2D subduction system containing
# distinct lithologies for the mantle wedge and subducting sediment,
# mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), gabbro, peridotite. Lithologies within the slab
# are prescribed to an initial hydration state after a period of equilibration, and
# subsequently dehydrate as they subduct. This cookbook utlizes the existing melt framework
# within ASPECT which governs the mechanical coupling of a solid and fluid phase (see
# https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw329) but introduces solid-volatile reactions
# that are governed by an approximation
# published by Tian et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008488).
# In detail, the model simulates the upper 20 km of a subducting slab with a dip
# of 45 degrees and a convergence rate of 5 cm/yr. The Cartesian box is rotated
# such that the x-axis aligns with the slab surface and the y-axis is orthogonal
# to the slab surface, while gravity is imposed at an angle of 45 degrees. A surface pressure
# of 1 GPa is imposed to account for the model simulating a portion of the slab
# that is already subducted. For stability, the slab first subducts for 100 kyr before
# the hydration is added, and the slab surface temperature diffuses to the mantle over
# 10 km perpendicular to the slab surface. From the slab surface to the base of the model,
# the composition is comprised of a 5 km thick layer of sediment with 3 wt% water,
# below is a 7 km thick layer of MORB with 2 wt% water, and below that is an
# 8 km thick layer of gabbro with 1 wt% water.

  # wt% water on the 4 lithologies. We choose fluid properties appropriate for water, and
  # set the Fluid reaction time scale for operator splitting to be 50 kyr. This parameter
  # controls the timescales for the dehydration/hydration reactions, and decreasing this value
  # will tend to make convergence more difficult since fluids will be released from the solid
  # phase more rapidly, increasing compaction pressure gradients. An important parameter that
  # can help inform model stability is the compaction length, which is defined as:
  # sqrt((eta_c + 4/3*eta_s) * k/eta_f)
  # Where k is the permeability, and eta_c, eta_s, and eta_f are the compaction viscosity,
  # shear viscosity, and fluid viscosity respectively. Ensuring that the mesh can resolve the
  # compaction length will aid in convergence. The compaction length for this problem at the
  # reference permeability (1e-6), the minimum shear viscosity (1e19 Pa s), and a compaction
  # viscosity of 1e19 Pa s results in a compaction length of ~4.8 km. Our mesh has a maximum
