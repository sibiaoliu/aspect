# A graphical user interface

Preparing a parameter file in a text editor can be a tedious task, not only
because the number of input parameters has grown considerably during the
development of ASPECT, but also because
remembering the names of commonly used options is a waste of (human) memory.
Therefore, we provide a graphical user interface that builds upon an available
program for deal.II. This GUI allows to
investigate existing input parameters, including their default values, modify
these values in a spreadsheet like environment and then save a formatted
parameter file that can be used to start an ASPECT model. In the following
subsections we describe installing and using this user interface.
