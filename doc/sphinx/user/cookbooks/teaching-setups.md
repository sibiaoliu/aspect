# Setups for teaching

Because <span class="smallcaps">ASPECT</span> is freely available, has an
extensive documentation and can be applied to a variety of problems in
geophysics, it can be a useful tool for teaching geophysics in general or
geodynamic modeling in particular. In the following section, we will present a
number of cookbooks that can be used for this purpose. Many of them are
modifications of existing cookbooks, but have been changed to run faster to be
more suitable for running them in the classroom, or they include additional
ideas for what parameters can be changed to learn more about the physical
behavior that controls the model results.

## Introduction to Geophysics

*This section was contributed by Juliane Dannberg, based on the course
&ldquo;Introduction to Geophysics&rdquo; at University of Florida.*

The course is designed to teach general concepts of geophysics, and it
includes the following cookbooks:

1. {ref}`sec:cookbooks:convection-box-particles` (using the files in [cookbooks/convection-box-particles](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/tree/main/cookbooks/convection-box-particles))

2.  {ref}`sec:cookbooks:heat-flow` (using the files in [cookbooks/heat_flow](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/tree/main/cookbooks/heat_flow))

3.  {ref}`sec:cookbooks:onset_of_convection`(using the files in [cookbooks/onset_of_convection](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/tree/main/cookbooks/onset_of_convection))

4. {ref}`sec:cookbooks:magnetic_stripes` (using the files in [cookbooks/magnetic_stripes](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/tree/main/cookbooks/magnetic_stripes))
