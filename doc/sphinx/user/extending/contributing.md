# How to contribute

To end this section, let us repeat something already stated in the
introduction:

:::{important}
ASPECT is a community project. As such, we strongly encourage contributions from
the community to improve this code over time. Obvious candidates for such contributions are
implementations of new plugins as discussed in {ref}`sec:extending:plugin-types` since they are typically self-contained
and do not require much knowledge of the details of the remaining code. Other much appreciated
contributions are new test models or benchmarks, extended documentation (every paragraph
helps), and in particular fixing typos or updating outdated documentation. Obviously, however,
we also encourage contributions to the core functionality in any form!
:::

Let us assume you found something in ASPECT to
improve, something you did not understand, or something that is simply wrong.
Do something about it! No matter whether you are a C++ expert or first-time
user, there are no such things as too-unimportant contributions, and if you
struggled with something, it is most likely somebody else will as well. The
process of contributing to a new project can be daunting, but we appreciate
every contribution and are happy to work with you on improving
ASPECT. To get you started we have collected a set of
guidelines and advice on how to get involved in the community. To avoid
duplication we store these guidelines in a separate file `CONTRIBUTING.md`
in the main folder of the repository, and you can also access them online at
<https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>. Even if
something in that file is not clear, this is an opportunity for you to ask
your question on the forum (see {ref}`cha:answers`), and let us know that file
needs improvement.
