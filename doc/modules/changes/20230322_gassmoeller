Changed: ASPECT now computes the pressure scaling factor that scales the
pressure solution to a similar magnitude as the velocity solution in
every Stokes solve instead of once per timestep. This reduces
the necessary linear solver iterations in nonlinear iterations
after the first if the viscosity changes significantly. 
The cost of every nonlinear iteration increases
slightly because of this change.
