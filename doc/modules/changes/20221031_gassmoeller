New: The 'grain size' material model now supports the grain size evolution
equations of Mulyukova & Bercovici 2018 in addition to the existing
formulations. For this purpose the old input parameter 'Use paleowattmeter'
has been deprecated and replaced with 'Grain size evolution formulation'. The
default behavior of the material model has not changed. Benchmarks and tests
for the new feature have been added.
