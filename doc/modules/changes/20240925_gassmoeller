New: The interface for particle property plugins has been updated.
The new interface can update particles cell-wise and is more efficient. 
In addition, the interface is more extensible for future improvements.
All particle property plugins in ASPECT have been updated, user plugins
will have to be updated accordingly before the support for the now deprecated
old interface is dropped.
