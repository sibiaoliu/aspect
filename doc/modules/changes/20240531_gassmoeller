Changed: ASPECT's default Stokes preconditioner has been changed from
a block AMG preconditioner to the geometric multigrid (GMG) preconditioner
described in Clevenger and Heister, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1002/nla.2375).
The GMG preconditioner generally performs better, but requires that
the viscosity is averaged using one of the material model averaging functions.
If models use features that are not supported by the GMG preconditioner
and the GMG preconditioner has not been explicitly set ASPECT will
fall back to the AMG preconditioner.
