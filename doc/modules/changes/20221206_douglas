Added: The 'adiabatic' initial temperature plugin can now use a spatially
variable top boundary layer thickness read from a data file or specified as a
function in the input file. Additionally, the boundary layer temperature can
now also be computed following the plate cooling model instead of the
half-space cooling model.
