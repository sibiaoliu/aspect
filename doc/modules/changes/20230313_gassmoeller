New: ASPECT now has a cmake option ASPECT_INSTALL_EXAMPLES that allows
to build and install all cookbooks and benchmarks. This will include
building all shared libraries during 'make' and installing all files
to the installation location on 'make install'. This is helpful for
installations that are used for teaching and tutorials.
