Changed: The benchmarks 'blankenbach' and 'king2dcompressible' have been
reworked and extended. Changes include: (1) higher resolution, (2) more
reproducible convergence results, (3) additional figures, (4) a comparison
between gradient based and CBF heat flux calculation, (5) reproducible
Richardson extrapolation of ASPECT reference results.
