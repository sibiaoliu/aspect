Changed: The class Particle::World has been renamed to
Particle::Manager. All references to world have been replaced
by references to manager in the source code. The existing header file "world.h"
is now deprecated and user plugins should instead include
"manager.h". In input and output options we now refer to
different groups of particles as "particle systems".
