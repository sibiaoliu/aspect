Changed: The A block solver in the expensive Stokes iterations
has been changed for free surface models from a CG solver to a BiCGStab
solver. This should improve the stability of the inner (top left)
preconditioner in free surface models. The new solver can also be forced
by an input parameter, which can be a useful option for models that
crash when solving the top left (A) block of the Stokes system.
