New: It is now possible to use the "initial topography" plugin system
for the spherical shell geometry, including using the ascii data
system that can then be used to import a text description of the
initial topography. As an example, we also include the file
`data/geometry-model/initial-topography-model/ascii-data/global_1deg.txt.gz`
that describes the topography of Earth on a (relatively coarse) 1
degree mesh.
