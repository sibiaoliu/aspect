Added: ASPECT can now use the 'include' keyword in parameter
files to include other parameter files, even if those other
parameter files include parameter files themselves. ASPECT now
also respects the parameters 'Dimension' and 'Additional shared
libraries' in the included parameter files, which was not the
case before.
