Changed: Default field types are now defined by ASPECT
based on Field Names if the types are not defined by the user.
The logic is as follows: if the name contains the substring stress, 
it has type stress. If the name is equal to 
s11, s12, s22, s13, s23, s33, it has type strain.
If the name is equal to grain_size, porosity, density_field, 
or entropy it has the types grain size, porosity, density or entropy
respectively. Otherwise it has the type chemical composition.
