Added: A new particle interpolator plugin 'distance weighted average' that
computes the interpolated properties as an average of particle properties
weighted by a distance function. This plugin is similarly accurate
as the 'cell average' interpolator, but provides smoother results and is
less susceptible to jumps in interpolated properties if particles move
small distances.
