Removed: A number of deprecated source code functions and input parameters
have been removed. In particular the deprecated option to specify
individual material properties in the parameter 
'Postprocess/Visualization/List of output variables' has been removed.
Input files will be automatically fixed and updated
by the update scripts in the directory contrib/utilities.
