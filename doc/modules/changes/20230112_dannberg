New: There is now a new additional material model output called
ShearHeatingOutputs that contains the fraction of the deformation
work that is released as shear heating rather than being
converted into other forms of energy, to be filled by the
material model. The boundary_area_change_work_fractions variable
(which provides the same information) has been removed from the
DislocationViscosityOutputs in the grain size material model.
