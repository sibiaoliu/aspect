Fixed: The grain size material model now computes the
stress that is used to calculate the grain size reduction
rate with the viscosity that has been limited between its
minimum and maximum given in the input file, rather than
with the unlimited viscosity. This is more consistent,
because the limited viscosity is the one we use to compute
the strain rate (and stress is 2*viscosity_strain_rate).
This updated implementation prevents artificial grain size
reduction in regions with large viscosity.
