Changed: The interface
Postprocess::VisualizationPostprocessors::CellDataVectorCreator::execute()
used to return an object of type
`std::pair<std::string, Vector<float>*>` where the second part is just a
raw pointer. This has been changed (incompatibly) to
`std::pair<std::string, std::unique_ptr<Vector<float>>>` to avoid the use
of raw pointers and ensure that memory de-allocation happens automatically.
