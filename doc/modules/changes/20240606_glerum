New: Added a Rayleigh Taylor instability benchmark with a free surface.
The benchmark was described by Kaus et al. (2010) and reproduced with
ASPECT with different stabilization schemes for the free surface by
Rose et al. (2017). It can be used to show that the stabilization 
scheme implemented by I. Rose allows for larger timesteps, and that
the projection of velocities onto the surface leads to significantly
different topography.
