Changed: The grain size material model now uses the
phase function class to compute where phase transitions
occur. This means that phase transition temperature,
depth and Clapeyron slope now have to be specified in
a different format in the input file (rather than a
comma-separated list, they can now be specified as
key:value1|value2|...). This is in line with other
material models. Note that the width of phase
transitions is still zero in the grain size model.
