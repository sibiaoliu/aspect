New: ASPECT now has a DruckerPragerPower rheology. This rheology
is based on the DruckerPrager rheology, but the strain-rate-independent
yield stress is replaced with a power-law rheology. The parameters
"Reference plastic strain rate" and "Plastic stress exponent" control
how the yield stress varies with strain rate.
