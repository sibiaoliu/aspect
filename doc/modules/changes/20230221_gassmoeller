Fixed: The depth average postprocessor would crash when trying to compute the
quantities "adiabatic_temperature", "adiabatic_pressure", "adiabatic_density",
and "adiabatic_density_derivative" for a single depth slice. It would also
compute these quantities at equidistant positions along a depth profile from
the surface to the bottom of the model, even if user defined depth bounds were
specified in the input file. This was fixed so that adiabatic quantities are
computed like all other depth averaged quantities by iterating over all cells
in the model domain and averaging the properties spatially. As a consequence
some functions in the adiabatic conditions interface that contained the bugs
and were only used by the depth average postprocessor have been deprecated.
