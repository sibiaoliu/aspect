Changed: The particle interpolator plugin 'bilinear least squares'
now activates a limiter by default, which prevents unwanted over-
and undershoots by limiting the returned properties to the bounds
of the particle properties in the cell. The limiter can be
deactivated by the input parameter 'Use linear least squares limiter'.
