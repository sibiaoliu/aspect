Fixed: There was a bug in spherical harmonic data reading of S40RTS 
and SAVANI initial temperature models when a maximum degree lower 
than the maximum degree of the spherical harmonic coefficients of 
the data file is specified by users to set up temperature field 
from spherical harmonic summation. This bug is now fixed.
