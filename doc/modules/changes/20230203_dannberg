Fixed: The Allow fixed temperature on outflow boundaries = false
option (and the equivalent option for composition) now also work
in time steps where the mesh is refined. In addition, if this
parameter is set to false, fixed temperature/composition are now
no longer applied to the boundary in cases where the flow normal
to the boundary is zero (as is the case in time step 0).
