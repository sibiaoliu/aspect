 Improved: ASPECT is now by default compiled in DebugRelease
 mode which compiles both a debug and a release (optimized)
 version of the executable. Individual build types can still
 be selected using 'make debug' or 'make release' or by
 setting the cmake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Debug or
 Release.
