New: ASPECT has new introspection functions 
get_indices_for_fields_of_type and get_names_for_fields_of_type.
There is also a new utilities function called
compute_only_composition_fractions that takes a vector of
compositional field values and a list of indices that designates
which of those fields correspond to chemical compositions.
It then calculates the missing fraction corresponding to the
background field, and returns the full vector of fractions.
