Added: A postprocessor 'darcy velocity' that visualizes the fluid
velocity in models with a compositional field named 'porosity'. 
This postprocessor is independent of the method the porosity is actually 
advected with, i.e. it could be static, advected with the Darcy velocity, 
or advected according to the two-phase flow equations.
