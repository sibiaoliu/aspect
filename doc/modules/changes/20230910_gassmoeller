Changed: The input subsection 'Particles' has been moved
from the 'Postprocess' subsection into its own subsection
at the top level. This is to make it more clear that
particles are not simply a postprocessing feature.
All included input files have been adjusted and the reformatting
script has been adjusted. Users will have to apply the reformatting
script to their input files manually.
