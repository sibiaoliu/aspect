New: Added fluid reaction and properties calculations to the 
Katz2003MantleMelting model in the ReactionModels module. These calculations
were taken from MeltSimple and the model now calls Katz2003MantleMelting. Additionally,
the katz 2003 option in ReactiveFluidTransport calls these calculations, allowing for 
melting and melt transport to be composited with any material model via ReactiveFluidTransport.
