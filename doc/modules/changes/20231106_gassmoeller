Changed: ASPECT now considers boundaries with no normal flow as
boundaries with inflow for the purposes of the parameter
'Allow fixed temperature on outflow boundaries' and the
corresponding parameter for composition. This was the default
behavior up to ASPECT 2.4.0. This behavior was changed in ASPECT 2.5.0,
in which boundaries with no normal flow are treated like outflow
boundaries. The new behavior caused unintended side effects, therefore
it is reverted back to the original behavior.
The reason for the initial change was a bugfix for boundary conditions
in the first timestep that is now implemented differently.
