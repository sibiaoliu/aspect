Incompatible: When using the "AsciiDataBoundary" class to read initial
topographies for the chunk geometry, the input file needed to provide
topographies spaced on a grid in latitude and longitude where the
longitude was to be provided from -pi (180 degrees west) to +pi (180
degrees east). This is contrary to the rest of ASPECT, which generally
uses 0 to 2*pi (0 to 360 degrees east) as a convention. This has now
been changed: The initial topography plugin will be asked about
topographies in lat-long with longitudes between 0 and 2*pi. This also
means that input files have to be changed correspondingly.
