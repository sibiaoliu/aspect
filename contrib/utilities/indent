# Indent a file.
#
# We use astyle 2.04 for indentation, which is a tool that predates C++11
# and that consequently has trouble with things such as
#   std::vector<Point<dim>>
# where it interprets the closing `>>` as a right shift operator. It then
# gets its template closing angle bracket counter all out of whack and
# produces awkward indentations. To avoid this, we first convert all closing
# `>>` into `> >`, run astyle, and then change it back. This leads to reasonable
# results.
#
# One might think that a regex substitution such as
#   s/>>/> >/g;
# would work (and putting the space on the left hand side for the way back).
# But this is not true because Perl does not go back to look at the substitution
# again, even with the /g modifier. As a consequence, the regex above
# replaces *triple* closing angle brackets as
#   ">>>"  ->  "> >>"
# and it does not look at the ">>" on the right hand side because the 'point'
# within the string where the regex matcher starts looking again with /g
# is now the last ">", having replaced the initial ">>" by "> >". Clearly,
# strings such as ">>>>" with four or more closing brackets encounter
# similar issues.
#
# The way to work around this is to replace "a '>' preceded by another
# '>' by ' >'". This is expressed with positive look-behind, and leads to
# the regex substitution
#   s/(?<=>)>/ >/g
# where "(?<=" starts the positive look-behind expression. Note that the
# look-behind expression is not part of the match itself (which is only ">"
# in the expression above) and is only used to restrict which occurrences
# of ">" are actually matches (and consequently substituted).
#
# For unclear reasons, astyle insists on appending a separate empty line
# at the end of the file. Fix this up using the last two 'sed' commands,
# using the same logic as in the 'ensure_single_trailing_newline()'
# function below.
