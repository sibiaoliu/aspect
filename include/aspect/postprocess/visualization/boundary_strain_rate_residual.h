       * A class derived from DataPostprocessor that takes an output vector
       * and computes a variable that represents the residual between
       * the a reference strain rate dataset and the strain rate computed for the model domain.
       * We only compute the residual between the second invariant of the strain rate
       * and therefore, the input data is an ascii data file with columns corresponding
       * to coordinates and one data column representing the second invariant of the strain rate.
       *
       * This quantity only makes sense at the surface of the domain.
       * Thus, the value is set to zero in all the cells inside of the domain.
       *
       * The member functions are all implementations of those declared in the
       * base class. See there for their meaning.
